## Project Description

This application is a backoffice system for managing an online book collection. The backoffice is designed for administrators, allowing them to create, update, delete, and view books, authors, genres, and publishers in a central database. This system helps administrators efficiently manage and structure book information.

- File upload (book cover image)
- One-to-many relationship: select author for a book (dropdown)
- Many-to-many relationship: assign genres to a book (checkbox-list)
- Dashboard with 2 statistics (books per genre, books per year)
- File manager for uploaded files (including delete)
- Search and sort in the book list
- Public API (fetch books, add comments)
- Protected against SQL injection (prepared statements)
- Modern layout with Bootstrap (Sass)
